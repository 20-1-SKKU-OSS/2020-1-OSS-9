<h1>소개</h1>
<p> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MusicBot is the original Discord music bot written for Python 3.5+, using the discord.py library. It plays requested songs from YouTube and other services into a Discord server (or multiple servers). Besides, if the queue becomes empty MusicBot will play through a list of existing songs with configuration. The bot features a permission system allowing owners to restrict commands to certain people. As well as playing songs, MusicBot is capable of streaming live media into a voice channel (experimental). <div></div>
